						<h2>The Hardware behind the Software</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Working at Panduit has provided great context to the capabilities and execution of industrial and enterprise networking. I've built equipment for cable testing, designed network zone enclosures for customers and built data center cabinets. A competitive advantage I have to most programmers is my experience working hands on with database hardware solutions from the world's top companies.</p>

								<h3>Big Data Analysis</h3>
							</header>
							<p id="Data">Cabling is a popular product category produced by Panduit. Testing can slow down new product development when large sample sizes need to be tested and analyzed. One particular innovation I've brought to the team is creating a new excel macro for importing, tabulating and graphing large data samples. I had no previous experience with excel macros and self taught myself because of this potential improvement I saw. What used to take a lab request and standard week wait time could be completed instantenously with my program. I was recognized among the team for helping provide this process improvement among others.</p>

								<h3>Lifecycle Management</h3>

							<p id="Lifecycle">From initial product ideation to launch, I have managed products throughout their lifecycle. Similar to Application Lifecycle Management, Product lifecycle management divides its work into distinct stages and uses Agile methods like Scrum to deliver. There's conception based on customer requirements or research and development, an initial design that goes through a design verification testing process, a realization phase where a finished good is validated through a verified process with scale in mind, then finally serviced where the part is sold and quality is continously monitored.</p>
