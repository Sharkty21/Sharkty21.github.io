						<h2>What I Love To Do</h2>
					</header>
					<p>How I spend my time away from work energizes me and bolsters my motivation.
						The travel bug bit me early on in life. Within the past couple of years I've gone from studying
						abroad in Australia, then touring most of Europe to now living in Chicago. While I travel, I
						love to document what I see by creating fun films to look back on. I am a huge Chicago
						sports fan and played basketball and volleyball growing up. Haiti is a particular country close
						to my heart, having made a mission trip there some time ago. We continue to support organizations
						providing aid to the country and plan to visit again, hopefully frequently.

								<h3>Travel</h3>
							</header>
							<p id="Travel">My love of learning inspires my desire to travel. I try to learn the basics of a language wherever I visit and do heavy research to find the best hole in the wall restaurants. From a semester abroad in Australia to backpacking Europe, I love being in new environments and hope to continue exploring. When I travel, I document highlights and create films to relieve these experiences. I am a self taught Final Cut Pro video editor, studying professionals in my free time to dive deeper in the shooting and editing process.

Growing up, I worked my way from a bench role to varsity captain of teams. The lessons I learned from hard work and adversity I faced have led me to persevere through difficulties in school and work. I am used to balancing many responsibilities and high expectations to perform my best in all of them. Being very social, sports led to me building many friendships throughout my life.</p>
